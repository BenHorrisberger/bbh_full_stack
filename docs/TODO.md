# TODO

## Add Pytest

* Get pytest working to test your code - pytest is THE standard tool for python testing. SSee how to integrate with UV (i found some online help). As usual, getting it hooked up is the hardest part. Then write tests to makes ure your reading and filtering work as expected.

## Add a clean task

* Optional (but good) - get RUFF (https://astral.sh/ruff) working. This will reformat all your code to make it look nice. Create a task called "clean" to call it. (And remember "uv add ruff")

## Git Status formatting
* do git status. Gives a warning of .history/ right? If so, add to gitignore. If not, then get vscode to give you a local history - you'll be happy you did!

## Next Steps

* Incorporate database.
* Integrate google api.
