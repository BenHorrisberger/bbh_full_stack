# Project Overview
Produce a web interface that allows a user to ask question about private jets and private jet travel.

## MVP
The interface will be a chatgpt-like input and chat style response with tables and/or links as appropriate. Context will be maintained during multi-turn conversation and handle corrections and clarifications.

## Example questions:

* Which aircraft can carry X number of passengers?
* Which aircraft can fly across the US without refueling?
* How many bags fit in a certain aircraft?
* How long will it take to fly from one city to another?
* Is a certain aircraft faster than another aircraft?
* How much would a trip from A to B cost on a certain aircraft?
* What is the expected weather at A and B on a given day?
